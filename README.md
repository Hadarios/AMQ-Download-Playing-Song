Here are my userscripts for animemusicquiz.com

## [AMQ Download Playing Song](https://github.com/Hadarios/AMQ-Scripts/raw/main/downloadPlayingSong.user.js)
Simple userscript that adds a download button in the song info of the revealed song.  

### WARNING  
You MUST install the [Catbox Download Helper](#catbox-download-helper) as well.

## [AnisongDB Download Song](https://github.com/Hadarios/AMQ-Scripts/raw/main/downloadSongAnisongdb.user.js)
Adds a download button in the info window of a song.  

### WARNING  
You MUST install the [Catbox Download Helper](#catbox-download-helper) as well.

## [Catbox Download Helper](https://github.com/Hadarios/AMQ-Scripts/raw/main/catboxDownloadHelper.user.js)
Helper to download songs from catbox with metadata from url parameters because CORS exists and I hate it.  
Seems to take a lot of time to start the download sometimes for some reason but I am way to incompetent to know why.
